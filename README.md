# SpiralSort
Traverse a list of two-dimensional coordinates along a spiral formation. The unordered coordinate list will be ordered so that when traversed (read back), the path between each point forms a spiral.

## Use cases
This is useful for automation, for tasks that require expansion of holes in a metal disc. Such expansion can cause an outer expansion of the disc. In order to achieve a uniform expansion, a spiral pattern is adviced. This algorithm was made specifically for this purpose, but could be useful for other tasks as well.
